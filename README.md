# About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Gnibus! My last name is pronounced **Guh-nee-bus**. My username shortens it to Gneebs.

I'm experimenting with GitHub to understand how people build things. I'm a writer and marketer with no formal computer education whatsoever who stumbled into a technology career.

Interested in learning along with me? Check out my newsletter, [Drop-In Class](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7162099914968158208/).
Short, entertaining explainers on trending technical concepts. Like a drop-in workout!
Past topics:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Unstructured data
- Vector embedding and vector databases
